# COMSC-165
Code from DVC COMSC-165 class taken over the summer of 2022. This was my second college level computer science course I took so I dove a little deeper into programming especially object oriented programming. However, a lot of this class was definitely review.

# NOTICE
I have tried to change all the name of the programs so that people can not directly copy and paste my code into their programs. In addtion, I have tried to review all information on my specific class and professor so that it would be harder to coorelate assignments.
